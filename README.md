Howdy!

This is the Overwatch™ Hero Ultimates Soundboard application I've developed. This project is a soundboard application that allows you to play the Hero Ultimate abilities from the video game Overwatch. 

Feel free to test this application to its fullest extent, in the current live versions this will play sounds as intended. If playing sounds from the Apple Watch, you will need to connect the watch to a bluetooth speaker due to the limitations of WatchOS2. In WatchOS3, AVFoundation and WKAudioFilePlayer both support speaker play.

This application is compatible with WatchOS 2.2 and iOS9.
